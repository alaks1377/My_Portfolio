# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/alaks1377/Portuguese_Bank-Marketing-_Analysis)

<img src="images/PB.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.


**Quantifiable result:** We could classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**86%** accuracy](https://github.com/alaks1377/Portuguese_Bank-Marketing-_Analysis).

- Used Logistic Regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscriotion depending on selected important features.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Cat_or_Dog_prediction/blob/main/CNN_Project%20(Image_Classification).ipynb)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**80%** using **23** epochs](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Cat_or_Dog_prediction/blob/main/CNN_Project%20(Image_Classification).ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
