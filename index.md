# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

***

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/alaks1377/Portuguese_Bank-Marketing-_Analysis)

<img src="images/PB.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.


**Quantifiable result:** We could classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**86%** accuracy](https://github.com/alaks1377/Portuguese_Bank-Marketing-_Analysis).

- Used Logistic Regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscriotion depending on selected important features.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Orthopedic Patients Prediction](https://github.com/alaks1377/Orthopedic_Patients_Prediction)

<img src="images/nb.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that I classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal.
 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**89%** accuracy using NB algorithm](https://github.com/alaks1377/Orthopedic_Patients_Prediction))

- Used K-Nearest-Neighbors and GaussianNB to classify Normal or Abnormal paitents.
- Analysed different parameters to classify patients.
- Explored a machine learning approach to Medical Analysis.

[Employee Compensation](https://github.com/alaks1377/Employee-Compensation)

<img src="images/ec.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Clustering, Elbow

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controllerâ€™s Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits, paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013. This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation.
 

**Quantifiable result:** We have grouped employees with [**3 Clusters**](https://github.com/alaks1377/Employee-Compensation).

- Used KMeans Algorithm
- Used Elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored an Unsupervised learning approach to create data group.

[Talking Data Fraud Detection](https://github.com/alaks1377/talking_data_fraud_detection)

<img src="images/FD.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Ensemble technique

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

 

**Quantifiable result:** We could cpredict whether a given click resulted in a download or not [**88%** Accuracy using XGBoost](https://github.com/alaks1377/talking_data_fraud_detection).

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who      downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
- Explored Ensemble technique.

[Hand Writing Digits Recognition](https://github.com/alaks1377/hand-writting-digits-recognition)

<img src="images/MD.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of handwritten digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Neural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**98%** using **5** epochs](https://github.com/alaks1377/hand-writting-digits-recognition).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
